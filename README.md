# StormSurge-v0.1-alpha
Combo of StormSurance and Veil/Auger Prediction Market {PM} system hybridization -- for dual exposure protection for users.

The point of this system is to combine the utility of StormSurange Auger PMs with StormSurance for both Oracle feed as well as dual utilization so insurance can be provided for the Stormsurance side and users can also play the markets with the PMs.

This allows dual utility of the core utility token of the system.
